# NotePallete - MERN stack application with Nest.js

A sticky notes type web application I built under MERN Stack to learn more about those technologies.<br/>

Hosted At: https://notepallete.onrender.com/
API At: https://api-notepallete.onrender.com/

> Note: Keep in mind that this API is hosted using Render.com free plan so it takes some time for the first boot (Within 15 minutes inactivity it goes to sleep again) as free plans uses cold boot . After first boot it works as normally without any delay
